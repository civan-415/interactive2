	<h1> Noguchi's Playscape</h1>

<p>Revisit Isamu Noguchi's designs for several playgrounds,
	as well as stand-alone play structures. Through models, sketches, set designs, and archival images,
	the exhibition offers a view of Noguchi’s vision for new experiences of art, education, and humanity
	through play. While few were realized, Noguchi’s playscapes continue to inspire contemporary designers
	to consider play as a strategy for building community and stimulating creativity in the everyday.<br>
